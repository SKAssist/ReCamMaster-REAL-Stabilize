coffee_test.mp4,"A human hand is seen scooping coffee beans from a large steel pot into a smaller white bowl with a thin blue rim using a black plastic scooper. The video is shot from an egocentric, first-person perspective, giving the viewer the sensation of performing the action themselves. The background consists of a light brown wooden tabletop with a visible hole in the top left corner, adding a subtle imperfection to the otherwise smooth surface. The steel pot is deep and reflective, filled with dark roasted coffee beans that shift and tumble as the scooper moves through them. The white ceramic bowl, accented by a delicate blue rim, contrasts with both the dark beans and the black scooper. The scooper, likely plastic, has a shallow rectangular head that captures a portion of beans with each pass, producing a soft rustling sound as the beans settle. The motion is deliberate and smooth: the hand lowers the scooper into the pot, fills it, then lifts and tilts it carefully to deposit the beans into the bowl. This process is repeated multiple times, emphasizing the rhythmic and precise nature of the action. The egocentric view allows the audience to observe the nuances of hand movement, wrist angles, and finger control. The environment remains still and quiet, directing full attention to the tactile interaction between scooper and beans. The lighting is warm and natural, highlighting the texture and sheen of the steel pot and the earthy tones of the wooden surface."
